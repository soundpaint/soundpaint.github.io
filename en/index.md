# JÃ¼rgen Reuter (SoundPaint)

Currently living in Karlsruhe, Germany, I am trying to combine my
R&amp;D expertise as software engineer / software architect with my
knowledge and experience in the fields of musical composition and
performance and arts, as well as natural sciences and maths.

In fact, inspiration for most of my projects originates from some
mathematical issue that I try to explore and / or tackle.  The effort,
though, may eventually be heading towards a completely different
direction, leading to completely new and unforeseen results.  While,
at first sight, my projects may seem to be completely unrelated, my
personal way of approaching issues forms an invisible, yet pervasive
intellectual bond running like a thread through all of my projects,
that strives to create a big whole.
