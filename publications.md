    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Supporting Gregorian neumes in music notation software requires
    formal modelling of music representation, as storage format and as
    input language.  Since neumes notation differs significantly from
    subsequent music notation, we give a short historical survey and
    explore a concept for musically adequate modelling based on the
    Solesmes monks’ 19th century research and more recent findings,
    including composition of ligatures from basic neumes, and compare
    it with different approaches.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In this talk, I present my project that implements a software
    emulation of a Z80 CPU and all other parts of a VZ200 computer
    (the hardware originally built around 1983).  The emulator
    software is written in Java, yet fast enough to run in realtime on
    current modest performance hardware.  Special features of the
    emulator include (among others):

    * a monitor control program with features for editing, running and
      debugging Z80 assember code,

    * a retro-fit mechanism that allows for annotation of assembler
      instructions (labels, comments, etc.)

    * a virtual clock mechanism that allows for realtime mapping of
      the emulated speaker's status onto state-of-the-art, sample
      buffer based sound card devices,

    * an abstract, mnemonic-level, yet still flexible architecture of
      the CPU emulation that allows for straight-forward extension or
      replacement of new or alternative op-codes without explicitly
      fiddling around with deeply nested instruction dispatch tables.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    In this talk I will present how I modified the remote control of a
    cheap 15$ quadcop in order to add a computer interface:

    * First, I developed a small hardware board for signal tapping
      from and signal injection into the quadcop's remote control.

    * Next, I connected an Arduino board and developed a small
      software written in the C programming language, that does
      real-time signal A/D conversion of incoming / outgoing flight
      control signals, time-stamping and low-level signal processing
      of incoming signal data, and buffering of incoming and outgoing
      signal data.

    * Third, I connected a Raspberry Pi 3 board to the Arduino board
      and developed a Java Application that retrieves flight control
      signal data from the Arduino with the possibility to record it
      to a file.  Also, the application allows for replaying recorded
      data back to the Arduino for signal injection into the quadcop's
      remote control.

    * The next step would be to extend the Java application for either
      editing recorded flight control data or creating completely new
      flight control data from scratch.

* _Exploiting Coloured Hearing for Research on Acoustic Perception._
  Lightning Talk @ Linux Audio Conference 2014 (LAC2014).  ZKM
  Karlsruhe, Karlsruhe, Germany, May 2nd, 2014.<br />

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Coloured hearing is a form of synaesthesia with co-perception of
    acoustic stimuli as visual effects.  In contrast to acquired or
    induced synaesthesia, the genuine form is thought to origin very
    early in life and to not relevantly change over time.  Therefore,
    finding correlations between acoustic stimuli and visual effects
    with genuine coloured hearing and evaluating their visual
    significance even on adults gives hints on which acoustic
    properties have been significant for an individual since early
    life.  With this snapshot of significance taken from many
    individuals, we hope to better identify the border between
    congenital perception and perception habits created from cultural
    influence.  Knowledge about this border is essential for
    composition of contemporary music, as it marks the limit where
    musical parameters go beyond trainable perception and thus render
    irrelevant as compositorial means.  So far, for a preparatory case
    study we developed a set of sounds, tested it on a single genuine
    coloured hearing individual and present first results.

  Synthesizer._ In _Proceedings of the 12th International Linux Audio

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    The idea is simple and obvious: Take some Raspberry Pi computing
    units, each as a reusable synthesizer module.  Connect them via a
    network.  Connect a notebook or PC to control and monitor them.
    Start playing on your virtually analog modular synthesizer.
    However, is existing Linux audio software sufficiently mature to
    implement this vision out of the box? We investigate how far we
    get in building such a synthesizer, what existing software to
    choose, analyse what limits we hit and what features still need to
    be implemented to make our vision become reality.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Signal processing with discrete Fourier transform (DFT) works well
    in standard settings, but is unsatisfying for rapid changes in
    signal spectra.  We illustrate and analyze this phenomenon,
    develop a novel transform and prove its close relation to the
    Laplace transform.  We deploy our transform for deriving a
    replacement for the sliding window DFT.  Our approach features
    transient effect and hence shows more natural response to rapid
    spectral changes.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Recently, CPU speed increases only slowly, while the number of
    transistors per chip keeps growing exponentially.  Consequently,
    processors with multi-core architectures are pervading the market.
    Unfortunately, most existing software still can not exploit the
    parallelism.  Since modular software sythesis implementations
    typically simulate parallel hardware, they are designated to run
    on parallel hardware.  We examine different approaches for
    parallelization of a modular software synthesizer and discuss
    their advantages and disadvantages with respect to both the
    performance gain and the impact on the software architecture.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    Modern music production systems provide a plethora of sound
    resources, e.g.hundreds or thousands of sound patches on a
    synthesizer.  The more the number of available sounds grows, the
    more difficult it becomes for the user to find the desired sound
    resource for a particular purpose, thus demanding for advanced
    retrieval techniques based on sound classification.  This paper
    gives a short survey of existing approaches on classification and
    retrieval of sound resources, discusses them and presents an
    advanced approach based on ontological knowledge processing.

    <summary>Abstract</summary>
    We present a paradigm for synthesizing electronic music by
    graphical composing.  The problem of mapping colors to sounds is
    studied in detail from a mathematical as well as a pragmatic point
    of view.  We show how to map colors to sounds in a user-definable,
    topology preserving manner.  We demonstrate the usefulness of our
    approach on our prototype implementation of a graphical composing
    tool.
